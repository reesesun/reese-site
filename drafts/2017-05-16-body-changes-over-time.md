Within more than 65 years’ history, because of the increase of nutrition level over years and more proper training system, basketball players’ physiques have been improved. In 1947, the average height was 74.32” and increased to 78.93” in 2015. The average weight was 188.7 pounds in 1947 and increased to 216.1 in 2015 (Morse, 2015). In early phase, without precise calculated nutrition intakes and personalized training plans, the appearance of Michael Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and several other dominant gifted players could be explained by nature, nowadays astonishing performances from more and more players cannot be completed explained by nature talent, “nurture” is another important factor.
