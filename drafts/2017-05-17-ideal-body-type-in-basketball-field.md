title:  "Ideal Body Type in Basketball Field"
---

In general, except the determining factor, height, shapes of other body parts are also playing essential roles in success in basketball field. The length of the Achilles’ tendon determines a relatively long and slender shape of shank. This allows a greater jumping ability and higher crossover agility. Kobe Bryant’s Achilles tendons are about 11.8inches long and after his tendon tear, he focused more on shooting instead of dunking and using other explosive techniques, though he could not go back to his peak period. Wingspan can also give players a huge advantage over the competition. It increased the chance at blocking shots and getting rebounds. Wilt Chamberlain, one of the greatest player in NBA, has 8 inches’ wingspan. He had 23924 rebounds, which hold the record in NBA. Although basketball performance has been improved because of the changes on physique, no one has ever break his record after his retirement in 1973.
