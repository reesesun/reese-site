title: "Reflection 11 - Sexuality Discrimination in the NBA"
---

Even though people have been fighting for equity for LGBT group worldwide and some states in America have granted that lesbian and gay citizens have the right to get married, homophobia is still the touchiest issue in the world of sports. Homophobia, a word commonly used by general public, means “fear and hatred directed at those involved in same-sex relationships”. Although homophobia is widely used, the lecture also states that since “phobia” is more of a psychological reaction rather than a social phenomenon. In response, some people consider heterosexism a better word to describe the phenomenon (Schultz, 2017). In this part of the reflection, I will do some research on sexuality discrimination in the NBA.

In 2003, the general public was overwhelmed by Tracy McGrady’s assertion that five percent of the NBA players were gay based on the evidence he saw in the locker room and T-mac refused to make any further responses after the interview (Schmitz, 2003). As one can tell, athletes are forced to stay silent so that they can get away from troubles. Heterosexism truly affects athletes’ personal lives and professional careers. In 2007, John Amaechi is the first professional basketball player to announce his sexuality in public. During his career, though he didn't declare his identity in public, he didn’t deny or hide his identity as gay. In response, people who were aware of his sexuality treated him unfairly. He blamed his trade to Houston Rockets on Larry Miller and Jerry Sloan, the owner and the head coach of Utah Jazz. Although Amaechi was treated badly in America, the United Kingdom considered him as a hero and hired him as a special commentator (Sheridan, 2007).  In 2013, John Collins came out as the first homosexual player who was still active in the NBA. He was greeted and supported by his teammates, other famous players such as Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant and Tony Parker and former commissioner David Stern. However, with all these greetings, he wasn't offered any contracts when he was a free agent and after a short season with Brooklyn Nets, he decided to retire (Beck, Branch, 2013).

Today, even though the general public is becoming more aware of the importance of LGBT’s equity, there are still manifestations of heterosexism in the league like using verbal assaults on gay athletes and coaches (Schultz, 2017). In 2015, Bill Kennedy, a referee has worked for 18 years, was irritated by Sacramento King’s guard Rajon Rondo and declared his identity as gay. On December 3, Bill ejected Rondo because of four consecutive technical fouls in the game. Rondo couldn't control his emotion and abused Bill with homophobic slurs. After series of investigations, Rondo was ultimately suspended and fined with $86,300. He was the third player, who was punished by the authority because of heterosexism expression in the NBA (Gibbs, 2015).

To fight this discrimination phenomenon, the LGBT group should stand firm for the rights they deserve to have by using legal ways such as holding protests and parades. The general public, who support the party should express their opinions and explain their opinions to those who cannot understand the reasons that LGBT should be treated equally. In 2014, an opinion poll conducted by New York Times and CBS showed that 56% of the public supported for same-sex marriage (“Views on Voting”, 2014). In 2015, all states recognize marriage between same-sex couples on account of the Supreme Court. There have been protests and LGBT parades in major cities to show their determination on fighting for gay and lesbian’s equity through all these years.
