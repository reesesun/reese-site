In general, height is not the sole determining factor when it comes to success in professional basketball – other parts of the body must be of a certain caliber as well. The length of the Achilles’ tendon determines a relatively long and slender shape of shank. This allows a greater jumping ability and higher crossover agility. Kobe Bryant’s Achilles tendons are about 11.8inches long and after his tendon tear, he focused more on shooting instead of dunking and using other explosive techniques, though he could not go back to his peak period. 

Wingspan can also give players a huge advantage over the competition. It increased the chance at blocking shots and getting rebounds (Schultz, 2017a). Wilt Chamberlain, one of the greatest player in NBA, has 8-inch wingspan. He had 23,924 rebounds, which is an NBA record. Although basketball performance has been improved because of the changes on physique, no one has ever break his record after his retirement in 1973 (Wlit Record, n.d.).

### Body Changes Over Time

Since the conception of the National Basketball Association, basketball players’ physiques have become increasingly more aligned with ideal body types for top tier athletes. With more and more conditioned training systems and changes in societal nutrition trends, their body types have improved and become more equipped for the wear of the sport. In 1947, the average height was 74.32” and increased to 78.93” in 2015. The average weight was 188.7 pounds in 1947 and increased to 216.1 in 2015 (Morse, 2015). In the beginning, there was a lack of precisely calculated nutrition intakes and personalized training plans, but as well-known players have come and gone throughout the decades, one can argue that natural talent is not the only factor in the successes of these athletes. When analyzing players such as Bill Russell in the 1950s to 1960s, Wilt Chamberlain from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and Michael Jordan from the mid-1980s to the early 2000s, there is no clear trajectory in rising height and weight, so the answer is purely based on talent. In comparison, today, we can explicitly see specific tendencies of “nurture” that have an effect on players’ abilities.

### Is NBA Greatness Nature or Nurture?

“Nature vs. Nurture” has been a debate in sports for years. It raises certain questions, such as what do we gain naturally from genetics and how does our environment affect us? The answer is always the combination of environment and DNA. According to racial equality activist Richard Lapchick, the NBA was dominated by African-American players with a 74.4 percentage in 2015, and was the league that had the highest percentage of African-American athletes among all major professional sports leagues in the US (Richard, 2015). It is difficult to find concrete evidence claiming that there is a large disparity in genetical differences between African-Americans and Caucasians. Although this phenomenon can be explained by nurture side. A large proportion of African-American NBA players came low socio-economic backgrounds, such as LeBron James, Serge Ibaka, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose and Gilbert Arenas. As we have seen throughout the years with football players from “Muck City” for example, many professional athletes utilized their adolescent years playing sports as their extra-curricular activities (Schultz, 2017b). By contrast, many Caucasian youths had the opportunity to balance their time with a variation of extra-curricular activities besides sports teams. This cultural essence to many young African-American athletes paved the way for them to be recruited to major sport leagues after years and years of the sports being the core of their identities.


### New York – National “Hotbed” of Basketball

In The Talent Code, Daniel Coyle describes a “hotbed” as a place that produces disproportionate “Everest-size amounts” of talent. It is an environment that prompts the growth of some phenomenon (Schultz, 2017a). New York City is a prime example of this definition. “There were decisions made by the government and the parks and recreation department to provide a resource for people to play,” says Bobbito Garcia, the co-director of the New York City playground basketball documentary “Doin’ It In The Park: Pick-Up Basketball NYC” (Garcia, 2013). In the city, there are more than 700 outdoor courts, which are composed of half-moon hoops, double rims and chain-linked fences. They are basketball courts without referees, coaches and professionalism so that everyone can pick up the ball and play no matter who they are and where they from. Rucker Park is one of these courts, located in the famous neighborhood Harlem, and it was named after Holcombe Rucker, a local teacher and playground director for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. In 1950, he founded a basketball tournament in order to help poor youth achieve their childhood dreams (Nelson, 2013). In the tournament, the young players performed outstandingly, shocking the crowd. More and more talented youths came to the city to demonstrate their talents and condition their skills. This made New York a hotbed for basketball in the 1960s and 1970s. Pee Wee Kirkland was known as the first player in New York to perform a 360-degree turn on a move to the basket. In 1969, he accepted a contract with the Chicago Bulls with the fourth pick in the thirteen round. From 1970 to 1971, he was in the lead of the Rucker Park League Competition (Malozzi, 1997). Today, New York is not the only hotbed for young, talented basketball players, as the sport has become increasingly popular across the nation and broadcasted nationally, and now California has become the state that produces the highest number of basketball players because of its large population and the effects of role model such as Kobe Bryant and Stephen Curry.
