According to the lecture, technology makes things more organized, easier, safer, fairer and push the limits of nature. There are four types of technology innovations, external body technologies, competitive space technologies, implement technologies and internal body technologies (Schultz, 2017e).

### External Technology

External body technologies are designed to affix to athletes’ body surfaces in order to get a better performance during the competition. Uniforms, corrective lenses, shoes, braces and mouthguards are some external technologies being used on basketball courts. Originally, players were allowed to wear any suit like long trousers, jerseys and football attires. In 1901, Spalding catalogue listed the first basketball outfit: knee length padded pants, short padded pants and knee length jersey tights for lower limbs and quarter-length sleeve and sleeveless jerseys for the torso (Naismith, 1941).

As we can see in the picture, players were wearing wools are thick trousers. These materials were replaced by polyester and nylon in the 1930s. In order to enhance athletes’ mobility, the authority decreased the length of the shorts to above knees in the 1970s. In 1984, Michael Jordan complained that the shorts were too tight to play well and asked for loose-fit uniforms (Slade, 2013). Today, with the high-level performances of players, the basketball uniform has kept the culture since the 18th century without any controversial and medical issues. However, there has been debates about the design of the shoes. Athletic Propulsion lab’s concept 1 shoe was considered as external technodoping, which gains unfair advantages through technology mechanically and violates the spirit of the sports.  The shoe was designed to make players jump higher and run faster. It had a compression spring system, which can produce an instant energy in the forefoot (Schultz, 2017e). In response, such design was banned by the authority in 2010 to maintain the fairness of the basketball courts.

In my opinion, sports shoe is the biggest technological innovation in the history of basketball.

The first basketball shoe ever made was Chuck Taylor. It dominated the market for more than 40 years from 1921 to 1960 (Bowers, 2013). The shoe had rubber soles, which could keep players from slipping on the slippery basketball court, however, the rubber material was too hard to absorb the impact from jumping and running. In response, it was difficult for the players to jump as high as they can because of the risk of injury. The shoe was made of canvas, which failed to give enough support to the ankles and increase the probability of injury. During the 1970s, Puma, Nike and Converse made a grand entrance into the league with low top shoes. Instead of a rubber sole, foam wedge started to be used. A spongy foam wedge could give players a better chance to jump higher with smaller chances of getting injuries. Michael Jordan started to reign the basketball shoe’s market in 1984 all-star games (Bowers, 2013). In the early stage, Air Jordan was made of leather and thick rubber cushion soles and high top. These technologies protected players’ ankles from injuries during the fast-paced competition and enhanced their jumping abilities. The Reebok was also quite successful and unique during this period by pumping air into the cushion (Bowers, 2013). Even since Michael Jordan retired, all shoe companies started to corporate with famous basketball players to invent better shoes for different positions. For example, Nike worked with LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Kevin Durant and used new technologies to introduce better shoes for power forwards, point guards and centers individually.

### Internal Technology
Internal body technologies are used to change the internal body constitution to perform better during competition. It can be conducted pharmacologically, nutritionally, psychologically, surgically and genetically (Schultz, 2017e). Among these five approaches, I believe that nutritional and psychological technologies are being conducted every day on players of every kind of sport. It is essential to control certain nutrition intake levels in order to keep the body in specific shape and maintain performance. Psychological approach is also important as pre-game and after-game treatment. It can help with relaxing and concentrating. However, other three approaches are quite controversial.

Surgically technology is the type of innovation that helps athletes to perform better with conducting operations on certain parts of the body in order to achieve a better ability. It has become popular among youth and professional athletes recently. In 2007, Lebron James had Lasik, an eye surgery that improves one’s eyesight. His shooting percentage has increased about 50% after the surgery (Scaletta, 2011). A small part of the general public questioned that LASIK should be listed as one of the technodoping because it could give the players better eyesight and it was unfair to others that couldn't conduct the surgery. In my opinion, LASIK is different with performance-enhanced drugs. PEDs can enhance one’s body to a level that normal people cannot achieve. This advantage makes PEDs unfair. However, LASIK eye surgery can only enhance one’s eyesight to the best they can have under the natural circumstance, but not beyond the normal level. Surgical approaches can be considered as acceptable technology on the court, but doping is another issue completely.  

Doping can be stated as enhancing performance by taking medications, one of the pharmacological technologies (Schultz, 2017f). Anabolic steroids, EPO and human growth hormones are the common types of drug being used in the sports. Anabolic steroids are synthetic variations of the testosterone. It helps the muscle cells producing more proteins during exercise, thus, it’s quicker and easier for muscles to grow larger and gain more strength (Schultz, 2017f). EPO is one of the medications being used in order to conduct blood doing. It is able to increase the number of red blood cells in the body and such process can enhance athletes’ aerobic ability (Schultz, 2017f). Human growth hormones are normally being used in athlete’s recovery because of its ability to stimulate the growth of the tissues. All these three drugs have been banned by IOC (Schultz, 2017f).

There have been no more than ten NBA players to be suspended for taking PEDs in the past. The most recent one was in March 2017, Joakim Noah was suspended 20 games after testing positive for ligandrol (“List of NBA players”, 2017). The reason that there has been few major doping scandal in basketball is that NBA players are only tested four times during the season (Simmons, 2013). This makes advantages for certain athletes to take steroids without being caught. Besides, the league has banned HGH but does not test for it because they don’t hold blood test before 2014(Harper, 2013).

In my opinion, although doping in basketball is not as controversial as it is in cycling, track and field and swimming, it’s still an important issue that needs to be discussed and controlled. Basketball is a type of sport that needs good aerobic ability, fast recovery ability and heavier weights on the court to compete with others. Sometimes it shocks me that LeBron James can perform such well in back-to-back games after extreme short recovery time. In order to maintain the equity and fairness of the game, I think it is important to hold drug tests frequently during the seasons. Certain athletes with health issues like growth hormone deficiency can be allowed to take prohibited medications under the strict supervision. I believed that everyone deserves a chance to realize his dream on the court and genetic disease shouldn’t be the barrier. However, it also shouldn’t be the excuse of taking advantage by doping.
