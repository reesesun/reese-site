title:  "Is NBA Greatness Nature or Nurture?"
---

“Nature vs. Nurture” has been a debate in sports for years. It rises the debate about who you are and what we are born from our DNA and how we are raised from our culture. The answer is always the combination of both of them. According to racial equality activist Richard Lapchick, in 2015, NBA was dominated by African-American players with a 74.4 percentage and was the league that has the highest percentage among all major professional sports leagues in the US (Richard, 2015). There is no certain evidence shows that there is a huge genetic difference between African-American and Caucasian. Although this phenomenon can be explained by nurture side. A large proportion of African-American NBA players came from essentially nothing such as LeBron James, Serge Ibaka, Jimmy Butler, Derrick Rose and Gilbert Arenas. Similar with football players came from “Muck City”, they spent their adolescence on basketball because they did not have money for schools. By contrast, a majority of Caucasian youths spent most of their time on schoolwork instead of playing on a basketball field incessantly. This cultural background made a large number of African-Americans pay many efforts on basketball and other major sports and they get the better chance at being recruited by famous teams in response.
