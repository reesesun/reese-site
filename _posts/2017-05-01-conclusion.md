title: Conclusion

By using historical sensibility, an ability to sense the changes of sports over time (Schultz, 2017a), we can see that the discrimination against basketball players based on social identity has the biggest changes over time. 

The general public has accepted desegregation, the process that ends systematic racism, and executed integration, the process that makes the structure of the society racial equal (Schultz, 2017b). Due to the efforts made by the pioneers, the fact that only four African-American players could be signed by each team and they weren’t allowed to score as much as they can have been changed (Johnson, 2009). Today, about 75% of the players in the NBA are African-American and more than half of the records were created by African Americans (Lapchick,2015). 

Male preserve phenomenon, the fact that the majority of the players were men (Schultz, 2017c), has been replaced by the rising of female athletes take the positions. Today, women athletes are no less successful than male athletes. 

Although the nowadays basketball has been developed well, there are issues that still need to be solved in order to create a more equal and cleaner court for every player. From my point of view, discrimination against LGBTQ is still one of the biggest challenges on the basketball court. Another big challenge is doping. The authority needs to invent better and comprehensive ruling system to prohibit such events from happening. 

With the development of the technology, I believe that the players will perform much better and continuously break the old records by combining the technology and physical ability. However, technodoping will also be developed and become a universal phenomenon. With the help of new doping methods, astonishing performances are expected to be witnessed and more athletes will be suspended for cheating. There has been only seven suspensions in the league so far, which can be considered as personal troubles (“List of players”, 2017) (Schultz, 2017a). After 100 years, it is possible that doping will become a public issue in the NBA.
