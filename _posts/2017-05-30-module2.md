title: "Module II: sport and social identities"
---

Social identity is a person’s sense of who they are based on the groups in which they are involved (Tajfei, 2004). For example, I consider myself a heterosexual Asian because I was born and raised in China, have Chinese citizenship, and consider myself a heterosexual. The ways in which we label and group ourselves help us discover our identities, but these identities can then lead to misunderstandings and prejudices from other groups. This module will explore race, gender, sexuality, and the ways these three categories have affected the history of basketball.

### Sexuality on basketball courts

Homophobia is defined as the “fear and hatred directed at those involved in same-sex relationships” (Schultz, 2017c). Although homophobia is the widely-used term, “phobia” is more of a psychological reaction, so heterosexism defines this social phenomenon more accurately (Schultz, 2017c). LGBTQ+ equality has been a long fight, not only in America, but also worldwide, but heterosexism has persisted in the sports arena. Not only is it difficult for athletes to “come out” or publicly acknowledge their sexual preferences, they are then not taken as seriously and may have to succumb to prejudices and belief that their talent can be questioned. There is also the possibility of criticism, ridicule, and cruel jokes towards these athletes.

In 2003, the public was overwhelmed by Tracy McGrady’s assertion that five percent of all NBA players were gay based on the evidence he saw in the locker room. McGrady refused to comment further after this statement, which led to even more controversy (Schmitz, 2003). As one can tell, athletes are forced to stay silent so that they can avoid such public ridicule and the invasive media. Heterosexism truly affects athletes’ personal lives and professional careers. 

In 2007, John Amaechi was the first professional basketball player to announce his sexuality in public after his basketball career ended. During his career, he neither denied nor declared his fay identity in public. In response, people who were aware of his sexuality treated him unfairly. He blamed his trade to Houston Rockets on Larry Miller and Jerry Sloan, the owner and the head coach of Utah Jazz. Although Amaechi was treated badly in America, the United Kingdom considered him as a hero and hired him as a special commentator (Sheridan, 2007).

In 2013, John Collins came out as the first homosexual player who was still active in the NBA. He was greeted and supported by his teammates, other famous players such as Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant and Tony Parker, and former commissioner David Stern. However, despite all of the public statements of solidarity, he wasn’t offered any contracts when he was a free agent and after a short season with Brooklyn Nets, he decided to retire (Beck, Branch, 2013).

Today, even though the public is becoming more aware of the importance of the LGBTQ+ community’s equity, there are still manifestations of heterosexism in the league. Verbal assaults against gay athletes and coaches is still considered acceptable and is rarely condemned (Schultz, 2017). For example, in 2015, Bill Kennedy, a referee of 18 years, was targeted by Sacramento King’s guard Rajon Rondo. On December 3, Kennedy ejected Rondo because of four consecutive technical fouls in the game. Rondo could not control his anger and began to use homophobic slurs against Kennedy. After series of investigations and Kennedy publicly coming out as gay, Rondo was ultimately suspended and fined with $86,300. He was the third player to be punished by the authorities because of heterosexism expression in the NBA (Gibbs, 2015). These crude and rude comments by members of the media are a reminder of the continued negative view of members of the LGBTQ+ community in society. It reflects people’s ignorance, stubbornness and hatred for others.

Homosexuality is a very sensitive issue. After all the above events, we can image how hard it is to openly admit to being a homosexual. Individuals fear the rejection, ridicule and insensitivity displayed by individuals and groups in society. In response, they are forced to stay silent and sacrifice their happiness.

### Racism on Basketball Courts

In addition to heterosexism, racism has continued to be a pressing issue for athletes of color in professional sports. According to Webster’s Dictionary, segregation is defined as to separate or set apart from others; isolate or to require, often with force, the separation of a specific racial, religious, or other group from the body of society (Merriam-Webster’s, 2016). “Separate but equal” was a doctrine confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1896, which allowed segregation and restricted the civil rights and equities of African Americans. The establishment of this doctrine was because of the leftover of the slavery, which was hard to be erased.

 At that time, whites believed that whites and blacks were treated equally but separately. This manifested in Jim Crow laws that created separate bathrooms, drinking fountains, public transportation and a variety of other segregated areas of daily life. The doctrine was not overruled until late 20th century after a long judicial process (Rothman, 2016). 

This legal segregation had large effects on basketball, too. There were five men who are considered the pioneers of leading the fight to integrate African-Americans into the NBA - Harry “Bucky” Lew, Chuck Cooper, Earl Lloyd, Harold Hunter, Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton, and Hank DeZonie. 1950 will rest as the year of incredible strides for African-Americans in the NBA, as 5 men would cross the color barrier in a span of nine months. Harry “Bucky” Lew led the fight earlier on, and is considered the first African-American to sign a professional basketball contract in 1902, when he signed with the Lowell, Massachusetts’s Pawtucket Athletic Club (Kentake, 2016). If it weren’t for him, it would have been impossible for the NBA to then have its first black player in 1950, first all-black starting five in 1963, and first black head coach in 1966. 

The NBA was founded in 1946 and Wat Misaka was the first non-white professional player. He only played one year, 1947, in New York Knicks (Schultz, 2017d). He was the sign of desegregation on basketball court and broke the NBA color barrier. 

Although the doctrine of segregation had been abolished and black players started to be accepted by the league, there were still leftovers. Back then, the NBA had an informal quota system, which was no more than two to four African Americans could play in the team (Schultz, 2017d). And these colored players were refused by hotels and restaurants or even spat by the audience (Spears, 2017). They hold their angers and played harder instead of having fights under unfair treatments. They fought for respects and made efforts on desegregation by their performance instead of their fists. 
 According to Mark Johnson, a professional basketball player and Andrew Johnson’s son, the black players were not allowed to score initially and the first scores were from Elgin Baylor and Oscar Robinson, who came along in the early 1960s (Mark, 2009). In the 1950s, the NBA was still dominated by whites until a few black players started break the color line and play for select teams. Wilt Chamberlain entered the league in 1960, and the realm of professional basketball was never the same. The seven-foot tall athlete changed the rules of the game, and made numerous owners and businessmen realize that African-Americans were a necessary component of the game (Bock, 2007).

Today, The NBA is the most influential men’s professional basketball league in the world and about 75% of the players are African-American (Lapchick,2015). Not only in basketball, but also many other major sports leagues are dominated by African-Americans. Despite this growth, there are still momentary racist lapses, such as the sentiment that “white men can’t jump” that began to appear on social media. People will always segregate athletes by their skin color and associate it with their skill set, but the dominant ideology has begun to focus more individuals’ performances than race itself.

### Sexism on basketball courts

As a female, I think watching LeBron James is more exciting than watching Candace Parker, a professional basketball player who currently players for Los Angeles Sparks in the WNBA, even though they are both top players in basketball. 

The exclusion of women in sports goes back to ancient Greece more than 2500 years ago. Women have been fighting for respect in sports for a long time and have made great titles in sports such as basketball, hockey and soccer, but are still overlooked (Gibson, 2016). According to the EDEA system, women’s teams are not funded equally as men’s teams in most major sports, including basketball. In response, women athletes are discouraged from entering the professional league (Schultz,2017c). 

Sexism appears not only in the administrative matters, but also the media. Less than five percent of television sports networks show women’s events (Good, 2015). The social misconception of women states that they should take care of their families and pay more attention to their appearances because they are physically unsuited for intensive movements. Sexists still portray women as pretty, fragile, and sexual objects. The women who are involved in sports are considered unattractive and unfeminine (Schultz, 2017c).

To create an equal playing field for women, the government established a law to protect their equities. TITLE IX was a milestone act that bans sexism in institutions. It declares that: “No person in the United States, shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” (Schultz, 2017c) Although the law is not flawless, it still produced positive impacts on female sports. Because of the support from the government, Cheryl Miller led the University of Southern California women’s basketball team to NCAA titles in 1983 and 1984. She also led the national team and won the gold in the 1984 Olympics (Woods, 2014).

Today, due to the establishment of TITLE IX, more and more women are choosing to be athletes, thanks to the efforts of anti-sexism workers and the wiser public. You can see high school and college aged girls carrying their sport equipment on campuses throughout the country. The old cliché and social ideology have begun to fade away from the public.
